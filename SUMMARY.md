# Originals Relaunch Landing — Living Summary

> Source of truth for design and product decisions in this repo. Maintained via the `update-doc` skill. When resuming a session, read this file first.

## Most recent change
2026-06-17 (latest): Deployed the **splice.com-style nav rebuild** (white wordmark, caret menu, white pill CTA, transparent→solid on scroll) and **fixed the headers falling back on live**: the rebrand's Söhne / Söhne Breit / Splice-Inter woff2 files had never been committed (a partial `git add` staged only `index.html`), so they 404'd on GitHub Pages and headers rendered in a system font; committing the three font files restored them. Live and verified (fonts 200).

2026-06-17: **Rebranded to the exact splice.com visual system.** Pulled the real design tokens off splice.com and applied them, replacing the earlier hand-approximated INSTRUMENT look. Electric-blue brand (`#1253FF` primary, `#03F` hover, `#528FFF` accent/link) replacing the pink→magenta→violet gradient; Splice's real neutral scale (`#121214` base, `#232426`/`#303236` surfaces/lines, `#C8C9CC`/`#A6A8AD` text); **Söhne** (web-fett) for big marketing display type + **Inter variable** for body; the real Splice logo-mark SVG in nav/footer; Splice's actual button spec (Inter 500, 8px radius, solid blue). Fonts are the exact Splice woff2 files, **self-hosted** in `assets/fonts/` (`splice-inter-var.woff2`, `soehne-web-fett.woff2`, `soehne-breit-web-fett.woff2`) — hotlinking was attempted first but the CDN blocks cross-origin font loads (allows only the splice.com origin), which would break on the github.io host (see Discoveries).

2026-06-17: Published to its own **public GitHub repo** (`francis-splice/originals-landing`) and enabled **GitHub Pages** (main/root). Live at https://francis-splice.github.io/originals-landing/ (page + covers + fonts verified 200; noindex prototype). Earlier the same day: migrated out of the `sfa-tokens` token-studies repo into this standalone working folder, fixed the standalone links, added `.claude/launch.json` (preview on port 8124) and `.nojekyll`.

## What this is
A hi-fi, clickable, responsive **conversion landing page** for the Originals relaunch: drive Splice paid-marketing traffic to INSTRUMENT subscriptions. "All of Originals. One subscription." for £12.99/month. Built from the [PRD](https://app.notion.com/p/381cb340c45c8172a97fef2525af1be4). This is a design prototype and the visual reference for the eventual Sanity production build, not the production page itself.

## Live URLs
- Live (GitHub Pages): https://francis-splice.github.io/originals-landing/
- Repo: https://github.com/francis-splice/originals-landing (public; `main` branch root, Pages source = `main`/`/`; publish = `git push`). `.nojekyll` present; `.gitignore` keeps `.claude/` out.
- Local preview: http://localhost:8124/ (via `.claude/launch.json`, `python3 -m http.server 8124`).
- Existing checkout every CTA targets: https://splice.com/plans/checkout?products=1064fbac-424b-4a68-8eab-981ad9cc2aef
- Plans page: https://splice.com/instrument/plans

## Project shape
- `index.html` — the whole page: inlined CSS + a small vanilla JS that renders the title grid and hero marquee from a data array and runs the audio player. Self-contained, deployable as-is.
- `assets/covers/` — 19 real Originals square covers, `sips -Z 800` downscaled (~3.8MB total).
- `assets/fonts/` — self-hosted exact Splice woff2: `splice-inter-var.woff2` (body), `soehne-web-fett.woff2` (display figures: value-math number, plan prices), `soehne-breit-web-fett.woff2` (headers h1/h2). Replaced the earlier Inter 400–900 set.
- `.claude/launch.json` — Claude Preview config (`static`: `python3 -m http.server 8124`).
- `.nojekyll` — so GitHub Pages serves asset folders as-is if deployed there.
- Audio previews stream live from the Spitfire CDN (no local MP3s).

## Audience and tone
First-party Spitfire/Splice design work (the user is a designer there), so no third-party copyright concern. It is a Splice destination page selling a subscription, so it wears the Splice INSTRUMENT brand, not the Spitfire product-page styling.

## Design decisions, newest first

### Brand & structure
- **2026-06-17 (latest)** — **Nav bar rebuilt to visually replicate splice.com's global nav** (read off the live site). 72px bar, **transparent over the hero → solid `#121214` on scroll** (`.is-stuck`, no border); real **white Splice wordmark** lockup SVG (the `icon-splice-logo-lockup` path) replacing the mark+text+INSTRUMENT divider; left menu = grey (`#C8C9CC`) 14px/500 links with dropdown carets (Sounds, INSTRUMENT, Rent-to-Own Plugins, Community, Pricing — in-page anchors for INSTRUMENT/Pricing, splice.com for the rest); right = `#A6A8AD` "Log in" text link + a **white pill CTA** (`#fff` bg, `#121214` text, 100px radius) matching Splice's "Try now" button. Footer keeps the compact INSTRUMENT lockup (blue mark + "splice" + divider). Note: carets are decorative (no real dropdowns) — acceptable for a visual prototype.
- **2026-06-17** — Headers (`h1`/`h2`) set to **Söhne Breit** (the wide cut), via a new `--font-headline` token (Breit-first). Regular Söhne stays on the big display figures (the £12.99 value-math number, plan prices) through `--font-display`; Inter stays on `h3` and body. (No header overflows; the pre-existing hero cover-marquee horizontal overflow is unrelated.)
- **2026-06-17** — **Switched from the approximated brand to splice.com's exact tokens** (electric blue `#1253FF`/`#03F`/`#528FFF`, neutral scale around `#121214`, Söhne + Inter, real logo mark, 8px solid-blue buttons). This **supersedes** the pink→magenta→violet decision below: that was a hand-built approximation of "a Splice page"; this is the real splice.com system lifted from their live CSS. Still explicitly a Splice (not Spitfire GT) look. The blue accent now carries every spot the gradient used to (eyebrows, chips, badges, play buttons, the £12.99 figure, featured-plan glow).
- **2026-06-17** — Built from the PRD as a hi-fi clickable HTML prototype (not the Sanity production build, not a spec doc). **Splice INSTRUMENT brand** (original approximation, now superseded above): dark base + pink→magenta gradient, self-hosted Inter, explicitly NOT the Spitfire GT tokens, since it reads as a Splice page. Real Spitfire CDN cover art for the 19 live titles + 4 styled "New" tiles for the not-yet-live perpetuals (Emotional Cello, Intimate Brass, Intimate Woodwinds, Crystal Keys). Single Subscribe CTA → existing checkout throughout, zero free-download. Prototype safeguards: status bar, `[Prototype]` title, `noindex`.
- **2026-06-17** — Section order (PRD narrative): sticky nav → hero ("All of Originals. One subscription.") → 4 value beats → Originals showcase → £600+→£12.99 value math → proof (walkthrough video + quote) → "more than Originals" platform band → Craft spotlight → two-plan pricing (INSTRUMENT featured + Creator) → closing band.

### Audio (surface previews early)
- **2026-06-17** — It is a conversion page for a sounds product, so audible proof belongs near first contact. The showcase covers are playable, a hero "Hear the collection" hook + 3 signature chips (Cinematic Soft Piano, Felt Piano, Epic Strings) start a preview above the fold, and a sticky mini-player (art, title, prev/play/next, seek, close) docks on first play and follows the scroll to the CTA. One detached `<audio>` object is the single source of truth (only one track plays, one tile highlights). Real Spitfire demo MP3s stream from the CDN via a slug→URL map in the page script.

### Craft (anti-slop)
- **2026-06-17** — Impeccable slop pass (brand register): no em dashes, no gradient text (the £12.99 figure is solid pink), no side-stripe borders (the testimonial uses an oversized quote mark). The two card grids are de-templated: 4 value beats are a numbered editorial list (01–04, hairline rules, no icons); 6 platform features are a borderless two-column spec list.

## Open questions
- Title count reads "23" (19 live + 4 new) vs the PRD's "22 (figure to confirm)". Self-consistent with the grid; adjust if the official count lands at 22.
- Deploy: resolved 2026-06-17 to public GitHub Pages (`francis-splice/originals-landing`), matching the `sfa-tokens` pattern. Audio streams from the Spitfire CDN, so the live page depends on those URLs staying put.

## Rejected directions
- **Local-download / placeholder audio** (2026-06-17). Considered downloading the 19 demo MP3s into `assets/audio/` (fully self-contained) or styling the player around silent placeholders. Chose **streaming the real MP3s from the Spitfire CDN** (lighter repo, audio-accurate, but drifts if Spitfire moves the files). Self-hosting stays the path to archival independence if needed.

## Discoveries (technical)
- **Deploy gotcha: `git add -A` and verify assets on the live host, not just locally.** Unlike `sfa-tokens` (which auto-pushes on commit), this repo only deploys on an explicit `git push`. A `git add index.html SUMMARY.md` (instead of `-A`) once left the rebrand's new woff2 files untracked, so the deployed `index.html` referenced fonts that 404'd on GitHub Pages and the headers silently fell back to a system font; it looked correct locally because the files were on disk. When shipping asset + markup changes together, stage everything and confirm the referenced files return 200 on `francis-splice.github.io`, not just on `localhost`.
- **Spitfire demo audio URLs** live in each product page's `data-audio-file="//www.spitfireaudio.com/cdn/shop/files/<name>.mp3?v=..."` attribute (read by the `<audio-demo>` web component), not in any JSON. Scrape with `grep -oE 'data-audio-file="//[^"]+\.mp3[^"]*"'`. The MP3s serve `206 audio/mpeg` with range support and play cross-origin in a plain `<audio>` element (media playback needs no CORS; only canvas/WebAudio analysis does), so stream the absolute https URLs rather than downloading.
- **Originals cover art** pattern: `https://www.spitfireaudio.com/cdn/shop/files/smcXXXX_square_press.{jpg,png}` (also via the collection JSON `https://www.spitfireaudio.com/collections/originals/products.json`). The four newest perpetuals were 404 (not yet live), hence the styled "New" tiles.
- **Splice's exact design system** lives in `https://splice.com/_app/immutable/assets/*.css` (SvelteKit build). Brand tokens (`--primary-btn`, `--ui-*`, `--text-*`, button spec) are in the global `0.*.css`; `Button.*.css` has the per-theme button vars. Real values: primary `#1253FF` (dark) / `#03F` (light), hover `#03F`/`#0029CC`, link `#528FFF`/`#03F`, base `#121214`, text `#fff`/`#C8C9CC`/`#A6A8AD`, button radius `.5rem`, Inter 500. Logo mark + wordmark-lockup are inline `<svg id="icon-splice-logo">` / `icon-splice-logo-lockup` symbols in the page HTML.
- **Splice fonts can't be hotlinked off splice.com.** They live at `https://spliceblob.splice.com/fonts/ModernEra/{Inter/Inter-1.1.css, Soehne/Soehne-1.2.css}` (Söhne is web-fett heavy + breit-fett wide; Inter is a 100–900 variable woff2). The woff2 files return 200 but Cloudflare sends `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://splice.com` **only** (per-origin allowlist, `Vary: Origin`); from any other origin the preflight 403s. Since browsers always fetch `@font-face` files in CORS mode, hotlinking errors out everywhere except splice.com itself — so the exact woff2 are downloaded (send `-H "Origin: https://splice.com"` to curl them) and self-hosted in `assets/fonts/`. Söhne has no explicit `font-weight` (it's a single heavy cut), so headings using it sit at `font-weight:400` to avoid faux-bold synthesis.
- **`new Audio()` is detached from the DOM**, so `document.querySelector('audio')` finds nothing; verify playback via the `play`/`timeupdate` events plus the network panel (the `.mp3 → 206` request), not by querying for an audio node.
- **Claude Preview's "desktop" native window is ~541px wide**, and forcing a custom width (e.g. 1440) renders screenshots black. Confirm wide-desktop layout via `getComputedStyle` (e.g. grid column count) rather than screenshots; use the mobile preset for visual mobile checks. Programmatic `location.reload()` can land the tab on the server root, so re-navigate to the page URL before inspecting.
